Question to answer: Identify an area of CSS code you feel really good about â€“ and indicate why.

Answer: I feel pretty good about general styling as it relates to color, font, sizing, etc...  The prior web development course that I took focused heavily on these styling basics to ensure the page was laid out the way I wanted or expected.  I also feel good about my ability to create sections or containers on a webpage that creates the desired display.  I'm more comftable with flex boxes than grids but have been practicing using grids to better understand the distinctions and styling to apply to a parent versus a child.
